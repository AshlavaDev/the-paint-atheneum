			could be found. Having to switch between different stores can be a pain, especially when you
			just want some basic information. The Paint Antheneum was created to solve this. There are
			1000s of paints out there and if you don&#39;t know what you are looking for, you can get lost
			very easily.</p></div> <div class="max-w-prose flex flex-col gap-3"><h4 class="font-serif text-2xl md:text-4xl text-darkblue py-2 text-center">Origins</h4> <p class="font-sans text-ls md:text-xl text-darkblue">This website was created as part of a certificate the creator (that&#39;s me, Ashley) took on web
			development. Unsure of what to make a website about, Ashley looked around their desk and saw
			the bottles of paint and unpainted miniatures. Which is strange, given that the hobby desk
			with the pile of grey is in an entirely different room. From there it made logical sense to
			create a database, from scratch, with every paint in it. Admittedly, a bit of a Herculean
			task.</p></div> <div class="max-w-prose flex flex-col gap-3"><h4 class="font-serif text-2xl md:text-4xl text-darkblue py-2 text-center">Support</h4> <p class="font-sans text-ls md:text-xl text-darkblue">Unfortunately web things cost money. Although this started using free resources, in order to
			grow it requires things like domain names, places to host stuff securely (GitHub is great but
			has limitations) and the ability to have secure connections for the API that grows as this
			website hopefully does. This website will always be free to use as long as I am in charge, and
			hopefully I can find ways for people to support the costs of the website without spending any
			money.
