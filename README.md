# The Paint Atheneum

## Ashley Morgan

### Purpose: A repository of paints used for painting miniatures

### Keywords: SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, Postgres, TypeScript, Supabase

### Description

This website is a miniature paint library (hence the name Athenuem, an ancient word for library). It is designed to eventually have all paints created for use in miniature gaming, of which there are way more than you would think Currently the site only has the paints of 2 companies and that is already several hundred. And finding them is manual work for me. The database, built with Postgres using Supabase, is created from a lot of information I collected including the paint name, company, range, colour category, paint type, and a hex code for the colour if I can get it. Eventually I want the ability to search these colours properly, as opposed to by certain criteria, and to have similar colours pop up so people can compare ranges. This was originally a React project built as my final project in web dev school, and then rebuilt using SvelteKit with a few more features added to it such as pagination.

### Limitations

The three biggest limitations currently are that the website does not seem to want to be hosted anywhere, there is no search bar type functionality yet, and the comparison between paint ranges does not exist on either the frontend or the database.
